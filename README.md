# Goal of the proect
The main task is to analyse steam_games data set, find dependencies, correlations and other useful information regarding the data

# Scope of the project
During this project I will go through different stages with which every data analyst faces on a daily basis. First of all, we have to import libraries that will be used later and take a brief look on data set. Next, I will go through data cleaning and data preparation, unfortunetely data set has a lot of missing values. Also, some columns are not usefull or have values with which hard to work, the task will be to transform data in such way that it will be easy to work with. Later on, data visualisation and analysing it will take place, it will help us to understand our data more. In the end we we will sum up everything that we learned from this data set
